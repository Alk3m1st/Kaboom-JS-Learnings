# Kaboom-JS-Learnings

Experimenting with Kaboom JS using a Mario-like clone (Initially from an Ania Kubow tutorial)

To run:

`npm install`

`npm start`

Building on the initial tutorial the project has been converted into TypeScript. Also to explore a more scalable solution the [Entity Component System pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) is being implemented. Although Kaboom JS seems to implement this pattern in some ways already so I'll try to balance my implementation and learnings against what's already there.
